# Project 4 - Design & Plan

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.


# Planning

## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?

- Our client is the Cornell Intercooperative Union (ICU)
- They would like a website to formally present Cornell co-ops onto the web
- They would like to have a formal web platform to recruit new "moseyers" (people would would like to join a co-op)
- They would also like an organized web space with all co-ops to facilitate archival of important co-op information

> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the Project 4 requirements.

## Site's Purpose (Milestone 1)
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.

The purpose of the website is to recruit new people to live in co-ops and to archive information (i.e. each co-op has their own page with the number of people living there, etc.)

## Client Meeting Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting.

![](client-meeting.png)

![](client-notes.png)
>Note: After we spoke, client mentioned another co-op that they had previously forgotten

## Client Needs and Wants (Milestone 1)
> Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.

Needs/Wants: Photo Gallery
- **Needs and Wants** [What does your client need and want?]
  - The client wants a photo gallery that will show the different people in each current co-op and some photos of events that were held.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Having a photo gallery that users can flip through. Each photo will have a caption explaining what it is.
- **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - A photo gallery with captions would meet the client's needs because users will be able to see all the people clearly, and can tell which group photo belongs to which co-op because of the captions. The users will also be able to see the events, because there will be event photos as well, also with captions. By making it a photo gallery, users will be able to quickly "choose" the next photo to look at.

Needs/Wants: Mosey (Joining a Co-op) Information
- **Needs and Wants** [What does your client need and want?]
  - The client wants to display information on the process of "moseying"/joining a co-op
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Creating a page section dedicated to the process, timeline, and requirements for "moseying" a co-op
    - This section will be inserted into the first/main page of the website
- **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - We decided to place the "mosey" information on the main page of the website because it will make the website easier to read, since the purpose of the ICU website is to promote co-op activities, especially in regards to advertising and recruiting

Needs/Wants: Page for Each Co-op
- **Needs and Wants** [What does your client need and want?]
  - The client wants information on all of the different Co-op houses.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Having a page that outlines each of the houses (will contain a picture
    of the house, the number of current occupants, the officers etc.)
- **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - As we will describe in the design process, we initially were going to put
    all the houses on a single page, but we decided it was a bit too much info
    on a single page, so we decided to split it into a page for each house


Needs/Wants: Inter-Co-op List of Events
- **Needs and Wants** [What does your client need and want?]
  - The client needs a list of information which can help them attend the necessary events prior to applying for a co-op.
  - An "Events" section of a page would organize these events for all available opportunities
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Add in a list or a table of events for the semester/school year
  - Place the list above photo gallery on aforementioned Photos and Events page.
- **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - The list will contain all of the events that will be happening for the semester/school year.

## User(s) (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the users (target audience) for this website.

The users would be moseyers, or people who are interested in living in a Co-op and are not interested in living in campus dorms or off-campus, like in Collegetown.

## Discovering Users' Needs (Milestone 1)
> You'll need to discover your users' needs. Talk to them! Document what you've learned about them. When talking to your users, take notes and include those notes here.

![](user-needs.png)

## Users' Needs (Milestone 1)
> Analyze the users' needs and wants from your notes above. List each need/want below. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> **Note:** These are probably *not* the needs of your client.

Need/Want: General Information (i.e. what a co-op is, how to join one, etc.)
- **Needs and Wants** [What do the users need and want?]
  - Users want to find out what exactly a co-op is like, and how they would be able to join them, along with other general information.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Having a homepage that will clearly state what a co-op is, and explaining how users could join one. There will also be a form that users could fill out where they can ask any other questions they may have that wasn't answered by the rest of the site.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - Having a homepage with this information on it will be useful for users because they will be able to find out what they need, generally, by reading the first page. Because the welcome page won't go into specific details and go very in depth into each co-op, the user won't be overwhelmed when they first click onto the site. The form will allow the users to ask any other questions they might have.

Need/Want: The different options of co-ops
- **Needs and Wants** [What do the users need and want?]
  - The users want to know the different options of co-ops that they could potentially try to join.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Having a separate, simple page for each co-op, with the names of them, a picture of the actual co-op, the names of the current officers, and the number of people who are currently living in the co-op.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - Having a different page for each website would be the best way for users to find out more about each co-op without having to scroll through one very long page with all of the co-ops. By putting them on different pages, it would be easier for users to learn the very general information about the co-ops, and by including the netIDs/emails of the current officers, users will have some form of contact in case they want to learn more about one specific co-op.

Need/Want: Who to ask for information on co-ops
- **Needs and Wants** [What do the users need and want?]
  - The user would like to know where to go for more/specific information
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - We will facilitate this goal by creating a  form that users can use to submit questions and concerns about co-ops and the ICU
  - We will also outline the contact information for each of the co-ops
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
 - We decided to create a questionnaire form because we thought it would be easiest for users to directly reach the ICU and for the ICU to receive questions, especially if the user is concerned about broader questions related to all co-ops and the ICU as an organization
 - We decided on spelling out the specific contact information for each of the co-ops so that if the users have specific questions targeted towards a specific co-op, the user can easily locate the information and contact them

Need/Want: Events that co-ops are having
- **Needs and Wants** [What do the users need and want?]
  - Users should know of events that co-ops are holding, both to apply for the groups and to know of major events which each co-op holds.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - All of the different events will be shown in a list/table.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - Allows user to determine what kind of schedule they will have given which co-op they apply for.

## User Testing Plan (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your tasks for evaluating whether your site will meet the needs of the users. These must be actual user testing tasks. Tasks are not questions!

1. Find out officer contact information for your preferred co-op.

2. Fill out the question form with the example question "Are freshmen allowed to join co-ops?"

3. Look for an event you would be interested in.

4. Find out the process of joining a co-op.

## Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 1)
> Come up with some idea for interactive features for your site.

- Form where users can submit questions they may have that aren't necessarily on the site already
- Photo gallery users can click through

# Design & Evaluation

## Design Process (Milestone 1)
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Design your navigation from the card sorting. Outline your navigation. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc.
> You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

![](card-sorting1.png)

![](card-sorting2.png)


![](design-drafts.png)
>All the co-op pages would look identical, just with their own names, photos, and information. The design for each will be the same.

- The theme would be Cornell colors of red, black, and white, with a very readable font (i.e. no cursive, etc.)
- The navigation bar would be at the top of the page, and would contain links to all the other pages.


> **Note:** Card sorting is used to organize your site's content. For each piece of content identified in the previous section, write a summary of that content onto a card. Now sort the cards. The grouping of cards provides you with your pages for your website. **Do not write down the pages you want and then "card sort" those. That is not card sorting.**


## Interactivity (Milestone 1)
> What interactive features will your site have? Describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.

- Form where users can submit questions they may have that aren't necessarily on the site already
- Photo gallery users can click through
- Dropdown menu, with a caret that changes up or down depending on if clicked or not

# Final Evaluation

## Changes Based on Lab 13 Peer Feedback (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on your peers' feedback?

- Changed the font of h1 to a sans-serif font, matching the rest of the site: Arial  
- Changed the background color from white to the yellow that it was before
- Broke up a long piece of text on the homepage (the text explaining the form) so that the eye is guided to the rest of the form in a more natural way

## User Testing
> If you conducted user testing in Milestone 1, you only need to user test 2 more users. Otherwise, you must conduct user testing with 4 users.

### User 3 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

![](user1notes-desktopA.png)
![](user1notes-desktopB.png)

### User 3 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

The user is a freshman in the architecture college, interested in urban planning, and we have one class together. She is a diligent worker and even tends to pay more attention than me in lecture. She is from the Long Island area, and likes to go on hikes around the campus here, like down to the gorges or to the botanical gardens.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?

Yes, the user belongs to the target audience. She is interested in the different options for living here at Cornell, that aren’t necessarily dorms.

### User 3 - **Desktop** (Final Submission)
> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

Task: Find out officer contact information for your preferred co-op.
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user was able to complete the task, though it did take more time than I originally thought it would. After looking back however, I think that this was only natural, because there were nine co-ops that she had to look through to choose one preferred co-op.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - The user’s reaction to the design was to click on the dropdown menu, and then, starting from the first co-op (Whitby), she clicked on each one and quickly skimmed through them. Even though the preferred co-op she chose was Triphammer, she didn’t make this decision until she had read through all the choices, and then she went back and chose Triphammer. She said that the activities like “pumpkin carving and camping” caught her interest, and I also noticed that she moved her mouse over the bolded “North Campus”. I presume that this was because she believed North Campus would be a good location, especially seeing as she lives on North Campus now.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think the user performed the task well, and without issues. In the beginning, I thought she was taking a long time, and then I realized that she may have to take this much time because she was going to skim through all of the co-ops. She answered the task after choosing Triphammer, and said that she would contact this co-op using the given email (triphammer@cornell.edu) and not using the netID of the current officer.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I don’t think that a redesign is exactly necessary based on the user’s performance to this task, because even if she took some time, that just means that she was trying to make her decision for the preferred co-op based on the short summary of each one. Because we bolded and emphasized certain words, like the location and the email, it was easy for her to quickly determine the fast facts about the co-ops.
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.


Task: Fill out the question form with the example question "Are freshmen allowed to join co-ops?"
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user did the task well, which met my expectations because this task was very straightforward. She did it quickly enough and seemed to find this task very easy.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - Her reaction to the this task was to first click back to home, and then, after scrolling, she was able to find the form that needed to be filled out, without having to click on other tabs first. She filled everything out without missing anything, and was able to click submit and not have any problems.  
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think that for such a straightforward and easy task, the user did it well. There was nothing she had questions on, and she completed it very efficiently.
- **Re-design choices**
  - Again, based on the user’s performance, I don’t believe that any re-design choices are needed for the form. The user was able to find the form quickly on the homepage, and filled it out without any questions. However, I do think that maybe the name of the link for the homepage can be renamed “About”, instead of “Home”, because I think that even if the user was able to complete the form without problems, it would add more clarification as to what is on this page.
 - **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.


Task: Look for an event you would be interested in.
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user did the task well, which I thought met my expectations, because she clicked on the right link and didn’t have to click on multiple ones to get to the right page.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - She went to the correct page, the Events & Photos page. First, she went through the gallery, and looked at all the pictures, before she even read the list of events. She said that the Wine and Cheese event at Watermargin looked interesting, but then mentioned that even if she went, she wouldn’t be able to drink anyways. Then, she looked at the masterlist of the events, and found one at Triphammer that she would want to go to: Spa Night and Demonology.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think that she performed the task well, because when she looked through the photos, and found the Wine & Cheese event, she realized that even if she was interested, she would not be able to drink. So, after looking at the masterlist of events, she was able to find one that she was interested in, and it was even at the preferred co-op she chose from task 1, which was good.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I think that perhaps the masterlist of events could have less spacing or a smaller font, because the list was so long, and the picture gallery was only at the top.
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.


Task: Find out the process of joining a co-op.
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user did the task alright, which met my expectations because the task was a little more vague, and required her to think about which page she would find the correct information on.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - She first went to the Triphammer page (this was the co-op she chose for task 1), and upon not finding the information needed to see how to join a co-op, she went to the home page and then was able to complete the task fully. On the Triphammer page was just the contact information for the co-op, so she could have used that, but on the homepage, she was able to complete the task and respond that to join a co-op, she would have to attend Mosey, and also go to the events held in Triphammer.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think that the user performed the task well, and it made sense that she would first click on the Triphammer page, because that was the co-op she would want to join.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I think a re-design choice would be to again, change the “Home” label for that link to “About”, because that is more descriptive and shows that there is more general information there.
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.


### User 4 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.


### User 4 (Final Submission)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

![](alice.jpg)

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?
- Alice is 19-year old sophomore student at Cornell University studying International Agriculture. She is white and female and is originally from Texas. She is interested in joining a co-op and moseying.

2. Does the user belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?
- Yes

### User 4 - **Mobile** (Final Submission)
> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

Task: Find out officer contact information for your preferred co-op.
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user was able to complete the task really quickly. This is because although there were nine co-ops that she had to look through, since she was always familiar with co-ops and had some favorite co-ops in mind, it was easy for her specifically to complete this task.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - The user’s reaction to the design was to click on the dropdown menu, and then go straight to the co-ops she knows and already likes / has a bias towards (660 and Whitby). She then was able to quickly find the contact information and current officers to contact since it was bolded and under a different section.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think the user performed the task well, and without issues. She answered the task by choosing both 660 and Whitby, and said that she would contact this co-op using the given email and use the netID of the current officer since it would be more personable to talk to a specific member / co-op president.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I don’t think that a redesign is exactly necessary based on the user’s performance to this task, because it took her a very short and smooth time to complete. Because we bolded and emphasized certain words, like the location and the email, it was easy for her to quickly find the vital information about the co-ops.
- **Additional Notes**
  - None.

Task: Fill out the question form with the example question "Are freshmen allowed to join co-ops?"
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user did the task well, which met my expectations because this task was  straightforward. She did it quickly enough and seemed to find the task very easy.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - Her reaction to the this task was to go back to home and quickly find the question form that needed to be filled out. She filled out everything smoothly and without problems.  
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I believe that for such a straightforward, the user did well. There was nothing she had questions for.
- **Re-design choices**
  - Based on the user’s performance, I don’t believe that any re-design choices are needed for the form. The user was able to find the form quickly on the homepage, and filled it.
 - **Additional Notes**
  - None.

Task: Look for an event you would be interested in.
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user did the task well, which I thought met my expectations, because she just had to click on one of the navigation bar pages to get straight to the page of all the events.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - She went to the correct page and found the list of events. She immediately gravitated towards to the co-ops that she was already interested in (660 and Whitby) to find the events that they hosted and chose a 660 event called "Garlic Night".
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think that she performed the task well. She was able to efficiently find the information needed and event aligned with the co-ops she was interested in.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I think that for the mobile site, the photo gallery should go on top since the list of events is so long. This will allow users to quickly navigate through the photo gallery then see the events afterwards, rather than not being able to even get to the photo gallery initally.
- **Additional Notes**
  - None.

Task: Find out the process of joining a co-op.
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - The user did the task pretty okay. This met my expectations - the task was a little vague, and needed her to think about which page to go on.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - She went straight to the home page and found the "Mosey" section of the front page. She read the information and found out that the mosey process occurs every semester and requires attending events at the co-ops she desires.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - I think that the user performed the task well. But this is true because of virtue of her familiarity with the mosey process already.
- **Re-design choices**
  - I don’t think that a redesign is exactly necessary based on the user’s performance to this task, because it took her a very short and smooth time to complete. Because "Moseying" is its own dedicated section right on the front of the Home page, it was quite obvious to find if you know the terminology.
- **Additional Notes**
  - None.

## Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

- Changed name of "Home" link to "About" instead
- Changed spacing of the events list
- In mobile, placed photo gallery on top (to the left in desktop) since the list of events is so long
- Added a formSubmitted page to let the user know that the front page form successfully submitted.


## Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)
> 1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.

1. The use of a dropdown menu for the pages of the co-ops was something that was well thought out, because we wanted to include a page for each co-op, to best showcase what they were about. This meant that they shouldn't all be on a single page, and instead, on different pages. Using a dropdown sets this apart from other sites, because it was well-organized and allowed users to not be overwhelmed by too many links in the navigation bar, making the site more user-friendly.

2. Another strength is the changing of colors and font-weight for the more specific and important details, such as the co-op contact information or the location. Other websites often do not do this, and as a result, users are forced to have to read the entire page in order to find these smaller and more significant details. However, on our site, users do not have to do this, and can instead have their eyes directed immediately towards these important pieces of information.

3. The information included on our pages, especially the specific co-op pages, is concise, and easy to read. Without overwhelming the user with a load of information, we were able to quickly summarize the uniqueness of each co-op, and give only the needed information they would want. Then, with the inclusion of the contact information, we allowed users to ask questions to the specific co-ops, in case they wanted to learn even more minute details about them. By not putting all these extra details onto each page, users who are not interested in that co-op are not forced to read through them.

> 2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.

- We would have liked to implement a timed slideshow (moving on its own) on the homepage, showcasing all of the co-ops immediately to the users, giving them a preview of sorts of what to expect

- If we keep working with this client in the future, we think that we would want to have the list of events change automatically for each new month, or even have it be a calendar instead of a list.  

> 3. Tell us what you, as a team, learned while working on this project.

- As a team, we learned to work together, and depend on each other for help. For example, when one of us was unable to implement the mobile responsiveness, another team member was able to help out and complete that section. This was valuable, because we were able to make progress on the website at the same time as learning new ways to do things.

> 4. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.

Because our client was the entire Intercooperative Union, we had to contact each co-op individually for the more specific details, such as officer names, events, and any photos they would want to submit. While some co-ops sent the needed information, and we were able to include them into the site, others, such as Wait Terrace, did not respond, despite several attempts to contact them.
